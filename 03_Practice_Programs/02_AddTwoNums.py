Description:
A Python program to add two floating-point numbers and display the result.
- Demonstrates the use of variables to store floating-point numbers.
- Performs addition using the '+' operator.
- Displays the result using the print() function.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize the first floating-point number and store it in variable num1.
2. Initialize the second floating-point number and store it in variable num2.
3. Add num1 and num2 using the '+' operator and store the result in the variable total.
4. Print the value of total using the print() function.

Time Complexity:
- O(1): The program performs a constant-time addition operation.

Space Complexity:
- O(1): The program uses a constant amount of space to store three variables.

Sample Execution:

Case 1: Basic execution
Output:
7.8

num1 = 1.5
num2 = 6.3

total = num1 + num2

print(total)
